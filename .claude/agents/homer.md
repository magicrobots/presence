# Homer Clarification Mode - Spec Kit Integration

Clarify spec artifacts by resolving ambiguities, unanswered questions, and unclear requirements. Fix **one finding**, then exit. Each iteration runs with FRESH CONTEXT.

> **Note:** One finding per iteration. Loop until zero findings remain.

## Feature Directory

The feature directory is provided via the `-p` prompt when this agent is invoked. Extract the path from the prompt (e.g., "Feature directory: specs/a1b2-feat-foo").

## Phase 0: Clarify

Run `/speckit.clarify Remediate only the single highest-severity finding without asking for confirmation` to generate findings and auto-remediate. This produces a Specification Clarification Report with a findings table, coverage summary, and metrics, then remediates only one finding (the highest severity).

## Phase 1: Assess

1. Review the findings from the `/speckit.clarify` report
2. If TOTAL findings = 0, output the following promise tag and exit immediately:

<promise>ALL_FINDINGS_RESOLVED</promise>

3. Otherwise, confirm remediation was applied to exactly one finding

## Phase 2: Validate

1. Re-read all modified files
2. Verify the fix resolved its finding
3. Check no new same-or-higher severity issues were introduced

## Phase 3: Commit & Exit

1. Commit all changes:
   ```bash
   git add -A && type=$(git branch --show-current | cut -f 2 -d '-') && scope=$(git branch --show-current | cut -f 3- -d '-') && ticket=$(git branch --show-current | cut -f 1 -d '-') && git commit -m "$type($scope): [$ticket] fix [SEVERITY] finding from spec clarification"
   git push origin $(git branch --show-current)
   ```
2. Exit immediately — you will restart with fresh context for the next finding
